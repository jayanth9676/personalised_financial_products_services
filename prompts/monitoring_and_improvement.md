# Monitoring and Improvement Instructions

1. Set up CloudWatch dashboards to monitor:
   - API Gateway request/response times and error rates
   - Lambda function performance and error rates
   - SageMaker endpoint invocations and latency
   - DynamoDB read/write capacity units consumption
2. Implement custom CloudWatch metrics for business-specific KPIs:
   - Loan application submission rate
   - Approval/rejection rates
   - Average time to decision
3. Create CloudWatch alarms for critical issues:
   - High error rates in API Gateway or Lambda functions
   - SageMaker endpoint failures
   - DynamoDB throttling events
4. Implement a system for capturing user feedback:
   - Add feedback forms after loan decisions
   - Implement a rating system for the loan application process
5. Set up A/B testing for different aspects of the system:
   - UI layouts and designs
   - Loan offer presentation formats
   - LLM prompt variations
6. Create a pipeline for continuous model improvement:
   - Regularly retrain models with new data
   - Implement automated model evaluation and deployment
7. Develop a system for analyzing user behavior and identifying areas for improvement:
   - Track user drop-off points in the application process
   - Analyze common user queries to improve the chatbot and FAQs
8. Implement a regular review process for:
   - Model performance and fairness
   - LLM and RAG system effectiveness
   - Overall system efficiency and user satisfaction

Note: Ensure all monitoring and improvement processes comply with data privacy regulations and ethical AI principles.
