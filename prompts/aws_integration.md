# AWS Integration Instructions

1. Set up the following AWS services:
   - Amazon SageMaker for model hosting and deployment
   - AWS Lambda for serverless backend logic
   - Amazon API Gateway for API management
   - Amazon DynamoDB for storing user data and loan applications
   - Amazon S3 for document storage
   - Amazon Cognito for user authentication
2. Deploy the trained machine learning model to SageMaker:
   - Create a SageMaker endpoint for real-time predictions
   - Implement error handling and logging for the endpoint
3. Create Lambda functions for:
   - Processing loan applications
   - Calling the SageMaker endpoint for predictions
   - Generating personalized loan offers using LLM and RAG
   - Handling user authentication and authorization
4. Set up API Gateway:
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for loan application submission, status checking, and offer retrieval
   - Implement request validation and error handling
   - Set up CORS for frontend integration
5. Configure DynamoDB tables for storing:
   - User profiles
   - Loan applications
   - Loan offers
6. Set up S3 buckets for:
   - Storing user-uploaded documents (e.g., proof of income, ID)
   - Hosting the frontend application (if using S3 for static website hosting)
7. Configure Cognito User Pools and Identity Pools for secure user authentication and authorization.
8. Implement CloudWatch alarms and logs for monitoring system performance and errors.

Note: Ensure all AWS resources are properly secured and follow AWS best practices for access control and encryption.
