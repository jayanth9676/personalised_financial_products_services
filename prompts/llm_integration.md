# LLM Integration Instructions

1. Set up AWS Bedrock for accessing pre-trained language models.
2. Implement a function to generate personalized loan offers using LLM:
   - Input: Customer profile data (loan type, requested amount, credit score, etc.)
   - Output: Personalized loan offer (loan amount, interest rate, tenure)
3. Create prompts for the LLM to generate loan offers based on different scenarios:
   - Approved loans with varying risk levels
   - Rejected loans with improvement suggestions
4. Implement error handling and input validation for LLM requests.
5. Create a caching mechanism to store and retrieve common LLM responses for improved performance.
6. Implement a feedback loop to fine-tune LLM responses based on user interactions and actual loan outcomes.
7. Ensure all LLM interactions are logged for auditing and improvement purposes.

Note: Pay special attention to prompt engineering to get the most relevant and accurate responses from the LLM.
