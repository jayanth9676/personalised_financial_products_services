# Model Building Instructions

1. Load the preprocessed data from the data analysis step.
2. Implement multiple machine learning models for loan approval prediction:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
   - Neural Network (using TensorFlow or PyTorch)
3. For each model:
   - Train the model on the training data
   - Make predictions on the test data
   - Evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Plot ROC curves and calculate AUC
4. Implement cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning for the best performing model(s) using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
6. Create an ensemble model combining the best performing individual models.
7. Evaluate the final ensemble model on the test set.
8. Implement a function to explain model predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values.
9. Save the best performing model(s) for deployment.

Note: Document all model architectures, hyperparameters, and performance metrics for future reference.
