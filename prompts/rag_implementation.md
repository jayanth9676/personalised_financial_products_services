# RAG Implementation Instructions

1. Set up a knowledge base using Amazon DynamoDB or S3 to store relevant financial information and loan policies.
2. Implement a RAG system using AWS Bedrock:
   - Create an indexing system for efficient retrieval of relevant information
   - Implement a query processing system to formulate effective queries based on user input
   - Develop a ranking system to prioritize the most relevant retrieved information
3. Integrate the RAG system with the LLM to provide context-aware responses:
   - Use retrieved information to augment LLM prompts
   - Implement a mechanism to blend retrieved information with LLM-generated content
4. Create functions to update the knowledge base with new information (e.g., updated loan policies, new financial products).
5. Implement caching mechanisms to improve response times for frequently asked questions.
6. Develop a feedback loop to continuously improve the retrieval and generation process based on user interactions.

Note: Ensure that the RAG system complies with data privacy regulations and bank policies.
