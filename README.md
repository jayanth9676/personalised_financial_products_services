# AI-Powered Personalized Loan Recommendation System

This project implements an advanced loan recommendation system using AI, machine learning, and AWS services. It provides personalized loan offers based on user data and utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced user interaction and decision explanation.

## Project Overview

This system aims to revolutionize the loan application process by leveraging AI and machine learning to provide personalized loan recommendations. It uses historical data to train models for loan approval prediction and employs advanced NLP techniques for generating personalized feedback and explanations.

## System Architecture

- Backend: Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and API Gateway
- Machine Learning: Models hosted on Amazon SageMaker
- Data Storage: Amazon DynamoDB for user and loan application data
- Authentication: AWS Cognito for secure user management
- File Storage: Amazon S3 for document uploads
- NLP Services: AWS Bedrock for LLM and RAG implementation

## Implementation Steps

1. Data Preparation
2. Model Training
3. Loan Approval Prediction
4. Personalized Offer Generation
5. User Interface Development
6. AWS Integration
7. Edge Case Handling
8. Monitoring and Improvement

## Rules and Policies

1. **Loan Eligibility**:
   - Minimum age: 18 years
   - Minimum credit score: 600
   - Maximum debt-to-income ratio: 43%
   - Minimum annual income: $20,000

2. **Loan Type Restrictions**:
   - Home loans: Minimum age 21, credit score 650+
   - Car loans: Maximum loan term 7 years
   - Education loans: Must be enrolled in or accepted to an accredited institution
   - Personal loans: Maximum amount $50,000

3. **Interest Rate Determination**:
   - Based on credit score, loan type, and loan term
   - Adjusted for risk factors (e.g., employment stability, debt-to-income ratio)

4. **Document Requirements**:
   - Proof of income (e.g., pay stubs, tax returns)
   - Government-issued ID
   - Proof of address
   - Additional documents based on loan type (e.g., college acceptance letter for education loans)

5. **Repayment Policies**:
   - Grace period: 15 days after due date
   - Late payment fee: 5% of the monthly payment or $25, whichever is greater
   - Prepayment allowed without penalty

6. **Fair Lending Practices**:
   - Comply with Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)
   - Non-discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age

## Edge Cases

1. **Recent Graduates**:
   - Special consideration for limited credit history
   - Factor in potential earning capacity based on degree

2. **Self-Employed Applicants**:
   - Use average income over the past 2-3 years
   - Consider seasonal fluctuations in income

3. **Recent Job Changes**:
   - Evaluate stability of new position
   - Consider reasons for job change

4. **Thin Credit Files**:
   - Use alternative data sources (e.g., rent payments, utility bills)
   - Offer secured credit options to build credit history

5. **Non-Traditional Income Sources**:
   - Develop guidelines for gig economy workers, freelancers
   - Consider consistency and sustainability of income

6. **Medical Debt**:
   - Separate consideration from other types of debt
   - Factor in repayment plans and insurance coverage

7. **Expatriates and Recent Immigrants**:
   - Develop policies for evaluating foreign credit histories
   - Consider alternative forms of credit assessment

8. **Cosigned Loans**:
   - Clear policies on cosigner requirements and responsibilities
   - Evaluate both primary applicant and cosigner creditworthiness

## AI, LLM, and RAG Integration

1. **AI-Powered Loan Approval**:
   - Use ensemble models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) for accurate predictions
   - Implement feature importance analysis for transparency

2. **LLM for Personalized Communication**:
   - Generate human-like explanations for loan decisions
   - Provide tailored financial advice based on user profiles

3. **RAG for Context-Aware Responses**:
   - Retrieve relevant loan policies and product information
   - Augment LLM responses with up-to-date financial regulations

4. **Continuous Learning**:
   - Implement feedback loops to improve model performance
   - Use A/B testing for LLM prompts and RAG retrieval strategies

5. **Ethical AI Considerations**:
   - Regular bias audits of AI models
   - Implement explainable AI techniques for regulatory compliance

## Setup and Deployment

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up AWS CLI and configure credentials
3. Install dependencies for frontend and backend
4. Train and deploy ML models on SageMaker
5. Set up Lambda functions and API Gateway
6. Deploy frontend to AWS Amplify
7. Configure Cognito for user authentication
8. Set up monitoring and alerting in CloudWatch

## Monitoring and Improvement

- Regularly review CloudWatch metrics and logs
- Analyze user feedback and behavior patterns
- Conduct A/B testing for UI and offer presentations
- Retrain models periodically with new data
- Continuously update the knowledge base for RAG
